#summary Trigger Validation Shifts - Video Tutorial

= Introduction =

Anton recorded a few video tutorials describing Trigger Validation scripts, including the use of Chicago's scripts.

The videos are hosted on youtube. It's highly recommended to change the video quality to "720P" and then watch the videos in full-screen, which will let you read the text in the videos.
