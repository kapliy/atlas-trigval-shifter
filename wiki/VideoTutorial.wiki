#summary Trigger Validation Shifts - Video Tutorial

= Introduction =

Chicago recorded a few video tutorials describing Trigger Validation scripts, including the use of our automated scripts.

The videos are hosted on youtube. It's highly recommended that you change the video quality to "720P" and then watch the videos in full-screen, which will let you read the text in the videos.
